# 'aluko - Phonotactics

The syllable structure in 'aluko is (C)(C)V(L) | N where:

- C is a consonant.
- V is a vowel.
- L is a coda-consonant: a liquid (one of `wrlj`), a non-palatal nasal (one of `mn`), or the sibilant(`s`).
- N is a nasal (one of `mn√±`).\
Note: `|` is the logical OR operator.

## Exceptions

- When a syllable ends in a vowel, the next one (if it exists) cannot start with another vowel.
- A glottal stop(`'`) cannot preceed any consonants and cannot proceed any non-coda consonants.
- Two neighboring consonants at the start of a syllable cannot have the same place and manner of articulation.
- If a syllable starts with a liquid, then it cannot be followed by another consonant.

## Non-differantiation factors

These factors are ones that may not change the meaning of a word (as in, if 2 words are entirely the same except for only these factors, they must mean the same)

- Stress
- Vowel length
- Diphthongs `ao` and `au`
