# 'aluko - Grammar

Here are some general properties of 'aluko's grammar:

- It is a pro-drop language, meaning that if no subject is specified for a verb, the matching personal pronoun of that verb is the implied subject.
- The word order is VSO (Verb - Subject - Object).
- Additionally, Direct Objects are placed after Indirect Objects. Similarly, attributes are placed after their describing nominal terms.
- Adverbs are placed at the beginning of each clause, and adpositions are placed at the end.\
(TODO: specify if pre/post-positions.)

## Nominal Terms

- All nominal terms exhibit case, number and ??? (T.B.D)
- The following are the cases of 'aluko:

| **Case**     | **Usage**                                   | **Marker**  |
| -----------: | :-----------------------------------------: | :---------- |
| Nominative   | Marks the subject of a clause               | c-          |
| Accusative   | Marks the direct object of a clause         | f-          |
| Dative       | Marks the indirect object of a clause       | j-          |
| Genitive     | Marks the possessor of another nominal term | s-          |
| Adpositional | Marks the object of a adposition            | z-          |

## Nominal Numbers

TODO

## Vowel Reduplication

Whenever two morphemes are linked and they do not form valid syllables, the inital vowel of the proceeding syllable is inserted between them as a monophthong to ensure correct phonotactical behavior.

## Persons

- There exist 3 persons in 'aluko, *First Person* (relating to the speaker), *Second Person* (relating to the listener), and *Third Person* (relating to somebody else). In their plural forms, the respective persons also refer to additional people other than their relative point, so the *Second Person Plural* refers to both the listener as well as additional people. For the *First Person*, there exist both an *Inclusive Plural* as well as an *Exclusive Plural*, which determine whether the listener is included in the additional people specified via *Plurality*.

| **Persons**                   | **Marker** | **English Equivalent**  |
| ----------------------------: | :--------: | :---------------------- |
| 1st Person Singular           | -om        | I                       |
| 2nd Person Singular           | -al        | You (singular)          |
| 3rd Person Singular           | -ur        | He/she/it               |
| 1st Person Exclusive Plural   | -em        | We (excluding listener) |
| 1st Person Inclusive Plural   | -el        | We (including listener) |
| 2nd Person Plural             | -ar        | You (plural)            |
| 3rd Person Plural             | -in        | They (plural)           |

## Verbs

Verbs are conjugated based on person and tense. The order in which these are specified is TPR, where T is the tense of the verb, P is the person and R is the verb root/infinitive.

| **Tense** | **Marker** |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Present   | ø-         |
| Past      | p-         |
| Future    | g-         |

Note: ø is used to signify the absence of a sound.

Note: The word *Marker* refers to a morpheme used to specify or differentiate between grammatical features/properties.
