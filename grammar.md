# 'aluko - Grammar

Here are some general properties of 'aluko's grammar:

- It is a pro-drop language, meaning that if no *Subject* is specified for a verb, the matching *Personal Pronoun* of that *Verb* is the implied *Subject*.
- The word order is VSO (*Verb* - *Subject* - *Object*).
- Additionally, *Direct Objects* are placed after *Indirect Objects*. Similarly, *Attributes* are placed after their describing *Nominal Terms*.
- *Adverbs* are placed at the beginning of each clause, and *Prepositions* are placed at the end.\

## Nominal Terms

- All nominal terms exhibit *Case*, *Number* and ??? (T.B.D)
- The following are the cases of 'aluko:

| **Case**      | **Usage**                                   | **Marker**  |
| ------------: | :-----------------------------------------: | :---------- |
| Nominative    | Marks the subject of a clause               | `c`-        |
| Accusative    | Marks the direct object of a clause         | `f`-        |
| Dative        | Marks the indirect object of a clause       | `j`-        |
| Genitive      | Marks the possessor of another nominal term | `s`-        |
| Prepositional | Marks the object of a preposition           | `z`-        |

### Nominal Numbers

| **Category** | **Usage**                                                 | **Marker** |
| -----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: | :--------- |
| Abstract     | Non-countable terms or cases when number isn't important. | -ø         |
| Singular     | Refers to singular objects/items/terms.                   | -`n`       |
| Plural       | Refers to multiple objects/items/terms.                   | -`s`       |

### Nouns

*Nouns* are the simplest kind of *Nominal Term*. They have no additional functionality.

### Adjectives

*Adjectives* are *Nominal Terms* which can additionally function as *Attributes*. In those cases, they describe their immediately preceding *Nominal Term* and encapsulate it to form a new one (that contains both the *Adjective* and the *Nominal Term* described).

## Vowel Reduplication

Whenever two morphemes are linked and they do not form valid syllables, the inital vowel of the proceeding syllable is inserted between them as a monophthong to ensure correct phonotactical behavior.

## Persons

- There exist 3 persons in 'aluko, *First Person* (relating to the speaker), *Second Person* (relating to the listener), and *Third Person* (relating to somebody else). In their plural forms, the respective persons also refer to additional people other than their relative point, so the *Second Person Plural* refers to both the listener as well as additional people. For the *First Person*, there exist both an *Inclusive Plural* as well as an *Exclusive Plural*, which determine whether the listener is included in the additional people specified via *Plurality*.

| **Persons**                   | **Marker** | **English Equivalent**  |
| ----------------------------: | :--------: | :---------------------- |
| 1st Person Singular           | -`om`      | I                       |
| 2nd Person Singular           | -`al`      | You (singular)          |
| 3rd Person Singular           | -`ur`      | He/she/it               |
| 1st Person Exclusive Plural   | -`em`      | We (excluding listener) |
| 1st Person Inclusive Plural   | -`el`      | We (including listener) |
| 2nd Person Plural             | -`ar`      | You (plural)            |
| 3rd Person Plural             | -`in`      | They (plural)           |

## Verbs

Verbs are conjugated based on person and tense. The order in which these are specified is TPR, where T is the tense of the verb, P is the person and R is the verb root/infinitive.

| **Tense** | **Marker** |
| --------: | :--------- |
| Present   | ø-         |
| Past      | `p`-       |
| Future    | `g`-       |

Note: ø is used to signify the absence of a sound.

### Infinitives

*Infinitives* are *Verb Terms* that fulfill a nominal role, and as such, they receive no conjugation. Instead, the root of its corresponding *Verb* is declined using regular nominal declension rules.

## Adverbial Terms

### Adverbs

*Adverbs* are the simplest form of *Adverbial Modifiers*, which are descriptors that convey useful information about the context(location, time, direction, degree, cause, manner, etc...) that an action takes place in.

### Prepositions

*Prepositions* are a type of modifier that can functions as *Attributive* and others as *Adverbial*. They function similar to adverbs, except that they also take an object, that must be in the *Prepositional Case*.

Note: The word *Marker* refers to a morpheme used to specify or differentiate between grammatical features/properties.
